# risk-and-uncertainty

This repository contains python code associated with the paper "Estimating Risk and Uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning". Each experiment in our work corresponds to one folder inside either "main" or "appendix" depending on where the experiment is presented in the paper. All experiments have independent code. Where possible we have created Jupyter notebooks that provide a straightforward method of reproducing the experiments.
