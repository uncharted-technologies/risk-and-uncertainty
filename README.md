# Risk and Uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning

Code associated with our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09638">Estimating Risk and Uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning</a>

# Requirements

Requirements can be found in the requirements.txt file.

# Structure

The project contains one folder per experiment in the paper, except for Atari experiments that are all within the Atari folder. Most folders contain a jupyter notebook that can be used to reproduce the corresponding experiment, except for Bandits and Atari where the associated computation cost is quite large. Each folder contains its own README.

A previous version of this code, associated with an old version of our paper, can be found in the Archive folder.
